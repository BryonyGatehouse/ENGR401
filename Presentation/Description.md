# Presentation

Create and present a slideshow lasting two minutes. Slides will automatically progress every 20 seconds. 

I presented a slideshow on the biases of Machine Learning focusing on the way gender stereotypes are presented in Machine Translation.

The points and slides I used for this presentation can be found in the [Notes](/Presentation/Notes.md).
